A simple real-time digit recognition app built by me and my teammate for an assignment of the ML class.

The codebase is structured as a multi-language monorepo, separating Python code from JavaScript code.
The `js` directory contains a PWA serving as the UI of the digit recognizer model, and the `py` directory contains the notebook for the model and can host any other python code.

Feel free to test the app on https://oaz-digit-recognizer.netlify.app/.
